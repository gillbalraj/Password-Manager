The Passowrd-Manager is a Node-Js application. I have used "crypto-js" library for implimenting the incoding and decoding operations. It does pretty obvious things like:
	1.  Creating a user account, if user doesn`t exsist.
		Creating a new account loops through various validations. 
	2.  Sign-In to retrieve the unformation of a user.
	3.  Updating the account information.
The passwords are stored in a very powerful (Hash Code) data.
